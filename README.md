A dumb [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/DirectPredicter) to predict Nintendo Directs.

### Credits
[CentroLeaks](https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks): Being a huge inspiration. They solely inspired this leaking gag by "leaking" Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl remakes every year until they come true. This bot works exactly the same as their Twitter account but automated.
